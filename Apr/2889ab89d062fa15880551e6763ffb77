 Ahead of the 2022 Abuja Area Councils election, a forum of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) support group has called on leadership and members of the party in the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) to support Tanko Yamawo to fly its Chairmanship ticket. Addressing a press conference at the National Secretariat of APC in Abuja Muazu Labo, who led the group said AMAC deserves the leadership of Yamawo who has remained loyal to the party despite contesting for the chairmanship position and lost on three different occasions. Labo, who described Yamawo as a grassroot politician who has maintained close contact with his people including women and youths, expressed confidence that the politician will do a great job for AMAC and to the party. “We know Yamawo is very good and loyal member of the party. He has been contesting for this position and lost on three different occasions, coming either second or third. Yet he didn’t leave the party for not winning the ticket. Rather he continued to support the party to ensure it won the last local council election. And today, he has come out again. “We want the party leadership to recognize someone who has been a loyal party member who has been in the party from inception helping the party to win election in his terrain. “He’s not like others who contest and when they lost, they go to another party but he has stood by the party. He has the party in his heart. Speaking on the capability of the aspirant, Labo maintained that Yamawo with his vast knowledge and experience and the team of seasoned civil servants he will work with at the local government, will take AMAC to the next level.
