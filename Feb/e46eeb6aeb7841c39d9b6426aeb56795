 Binance, a global cryptocurrency exchange, has thrown its weight behind the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic by the Nigerian government. The company through its nonprofit, Binance Charity provided 30,400 KN95 masks to hospitals across the country. As of February, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria was at 140,000, with 1,673 deaths. Launched on March 24, 2020, Binance Charity has grown to become the world’s first blockchain-powered donation platform dedicated to advancing transparent philanthropy. The donation to the Nigerian government aligns with Binance Charity’s Crypto Against COVID campaign created to raise $5 million in cryptocurrencies (BNB, BTC, BUSD, and XRP). The funds are to be spent primarily on buying medical supplies for affected regions globally. Binance led this effort with an initial donation of $1 million, plus an additional donation of $1 million through the #CryptoAgainstCOVID social media campaign. Binance has also pledged to match $2 million of public donation.
