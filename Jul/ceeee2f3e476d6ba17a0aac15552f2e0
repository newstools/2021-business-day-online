 The House of Representatives has approved 3 percent operating cost to be paid by oil companies to the Host Community Development Trust Fund in the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB). The approval was given at the extraordinary plenary of the House on Friday after opposition lawmakers staged a walk from the Chamber, following refusal by the All Progressives Congress (APC) dominated members to amend the controversial section 52 in the Electoral Act Amendment Bill. The Conference Committee Report on PIB was Thursday stepped down owing to the visible protest by lawmakers from the oil-rich Niger Delta region when it became clear that the 3% approval of equity shares by the Senate was adopted in the report. The House had last two weeks approved 5 percent operating costs by oil companies to the Host Community Development Trust Fund while Senate approved only 3% for the same purpose.
