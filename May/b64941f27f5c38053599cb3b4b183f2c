 Thousands of families in Lagos state will soon have reasons to smile as Pink Food Bank, a non-profit organization has launched an initiative tagged- ‘Wonder Box’ to provide a free box of food stuff to low-income households, retirees, and widows in the state. Femi Fidodo, project coordinator, in a statement made available to BusinessDay, said the initiative will help the masses cushion the effect of the upward surge in food prices currently being experienced in Nigeria. “According to the Nigeria Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigerian inflation is standing at an all-time high at 17.33percent. This has caused the prices of food stuff to increase and become almost unaffordable for the poor and middle-class. This forms the basis for which we are reaching out to this group of people,” he said.

Recalling past project, the coordinator said that Pink Food Bank had embarked on different projects such as the women empowerment initiative, women in business program, food drive for the handicapped, and feeding the kids, among others, adding that they are all featured in the organisation’s social media handles. Advising the government on the current food upsurge in food prices, Fidodo called on government at all levels to be empathetic toward the plight of the citizens while making policies as they bear the consequences of most decisions. He urged the government and all its agencies to formulate and implement policies that would benefit the common man.
