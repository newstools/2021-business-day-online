 Chi Farms Ltd., a member of the TGI Group and a leading agribusiness company in Nigeria, has concluded the expansion plan of its 36 million day-old chicks per year hatchery production capacity at Ajanla Farms, Ibadan to 44 million day-old-chicks yearly. “Expanding our operations will enable us to have better control, supervision, and most importantly sustain our quality standards while we meet the continuously growing demands from customers,” said Ananda Raj, business head –poultry marketing and sales, Chi Farms. Raj said that the expansion is necessary to meet the increasing production demands of day-old chicks across the country. He stated that the expansion project which began in June 2020 is projected to be completed and commissioned by August 2021. Also, Tunji Olaitan, managing director, Chi Farms, said there are plans for further expansions soon, noting that it is to respond adequately not only in terms of day-old-chick volume but also delivering premium quality offerings to the Nigerian poultry industry. “By next year, we will have an additional complement of eight setters, thus increasing the operational capacity from 44 million day-old chicks per year to 52 million chicks,” Olaitan said. According to him, these strategic investments are to ensure that Chi Farms remains the market leader with premium quality products and pacesetting in new technologies integration in the industry. Some of the innovations in the pipeline for Chi Farms include infrared break treatment machine (PSP), which offers stress-free and precision de-beaking options with real-time value addition. The farm is also accelerating housing modification projects and the conversion of naturally ventilated poultry houses to environmentally controlled houses.
