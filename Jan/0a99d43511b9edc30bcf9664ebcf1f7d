 The United States House of Representatives has passed a resolution urging Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove President Donald Trump from office. Pence has resisted pressure to remove Trump. On Tuesday, Pence sent House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a letter stating he did not support invoking the amendment. “I do not believe that such a course of action is in the best interest of our nation or consistent with our constitution,” Pence said. The letter was sent to Pelosi just as the House of Representatives gathered on Tuesday night to discuss the bill. The resolution presented reasoning for Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment, a constitutional action that would begin the process of removing the president from office.

Five people died, including a police officer.
