 Atiku Media Office has said its attention has been drawn to reports in a section of the media of campaign posters in parts of Abuja of Atiku and Professor Charles Soludo, an aspirant in the Anambra State governorship election. In a statement signed by Paul Ibeh, the office said: “Ordinarily, we would have ignored the reports, but for the interest of those who may be misled by the disingenuous plot. We know nothing about the posters or those who may have promoted it.” Ibeh further said: “It is obvious that this is a work of mischief. For the avoidance of doubt, Atiku Abubakar is of the PDP (People’s Democratic Party) while Charles Soludo is of APGA (All Progressive Grand Alliance). “It is silly of anyone to attempt to drag the former Vice President into an election in Anambra which outcome will be determined by the people of the state.” It said that Atiku was currently preoccupied with joining hands with other well-meaning Nigerians to help in finding solutions to the myriad of challenges plaguing the nation such as insecurity and economic downturn marked by joblessness and extreme poverty. “That explains why last Monday, the Waziri of Adamawa commissioned the headquarters of Standard Micro Finance Bank and two manufacturing plants, promoted by him in Yola to provide much-needed jobs and opportunities,” it further said. According to the statement, “We wish to restate that the purported 2023 campaign posters in circulation linking Atiku to Soludo is the handiwork of mischief makers and should be ignored.”
